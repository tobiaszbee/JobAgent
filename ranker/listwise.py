{questionnaire_text}{prefs_text}Your task: rank ALL {len(jobs)} jobs from best (rank 1) to worst fit. Consider:
- Overall match with candidate profile and experience
- Each job's "Scorer's rating" (if shown) is a per-job first pass made WITHOUT seeing the other jobs in this batch — treat it as one data point to weigh against everything else below, not a target ordering to reproduce. Your job is the comparative judgment the scorer couldn't make.
- The candidate's own stated questionnaire preferences (if given above) — direct and current, outranks the inferred preference profile when they conflict
- Preference signals (strong signals = heavy weight)
- Role quality, growth potential, company type
- Dealbreakers (REJECT[conf=ABSOLUTE/HIGH] signals)
- Posting age ("Posted: N days ago", if shown) — an older posting is more likely to already be filled or to have gone quiet; let it count moderately against an otherwise-similar fresher posting, not as a hard cutoff

Every job must appear exactly once in the ranking.

Do all your reordering and self-correction before you start writing the JSON — once you begin the <ranking> block, each "reason" must already be your settled, final answer for that job. Never write deliberation, corrections, or meta-commentary about the ranking process itself (e.g. "wait, correcting...", "actually X is better", "placing here by ID") into a "reason" value — it is shown directly to the candidate and must read as a clean, final one-sentence explanation of that job's fit.

After your analysis, output ONLY the final ranking as a JSON array inside <ranking> tags, like this:
<ranking>
[
  {{"job_id": "abc123", "reason": "Best match: senior Python role at product company, remote"}},
  {{"job_id": "def456", "reason": "Good but agency work"}}
]
</ranking>

Include ALL {len(jobs)} jobs. No text after the closing </ranking> tag."""
