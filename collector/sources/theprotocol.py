"""theprotocol.it source, Poland-focused IT job board, public and unauthenticated.

Unlike justjoin.it, this site sits behind Cloudflare and its headless-browser detection
is aggressive: a plain `httpx` GET gets a 403 challenge page, and even Playwright's
headless Chromium (with `channel="chrome"`) gets served the same "Just a moment..."
challenge. Only a non-headless (visible) browser gets through, verified live. So this
source uses Playwright end to end, for both search() and fetch_description(), without
any login or stealth pacing (public site, no account).

Listing and detail data are both embedded as JSON in a `<script id="__NEXT_DATA__">` tag
in the server-rendered page, no reverse-engineered wire format needed here, this is the
stable, documented Next.js pattern (unlike justjoin.it's newer RSC streaming).

The site's own search box only recognizes single technology names as filter tags (typing
a full phrase like "PHP Developer" auto-collapses to just the "PHP" tag in the UI, and a
literal multi-word keyword in the URL returns zero results), so search() uses the first
word of `title` as the tag, matching how our multi-word title criteria are all phrased
("Symfony Developer" -> "symfony", "PHP" -> "php").
