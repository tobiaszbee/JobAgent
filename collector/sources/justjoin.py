"""justjoin.it source, Poland-focused IT job board, public and unauthenticated.

Search results are fetched with a plain HTTP GET: the listing data (title, company,
salary, skills, workplace type) is embedded as structured JSON inside the server-rendered
page (verified live against the real site), so no browser is needed for search(). Full
descriptions aren't in that listing payload, so each new job's detail page is rendered
with Playwright to read the description text, the description is itself streamed inside
Next.js's internal RSC wire format, and reverse-engineering that byte-for-byte proved too
fragile (unstable across page loads) to rely on for real content.

This is a Poland-only board, search() only fires anything when `location` resolves to
Poland, to avoid firing the same query once per configured country for no reason.
