PREFERRED (increases score):
{preferred_lines}

Score the job 0-10 based on overall fit with the candidate profile, must-have criteria, and preferences.
Use the full range, don't default to clustering scores in 6-8:
- 9-10: Exceptional, matches nearly everything the candidate wants, no real cons.
- 7-8: Strong, clearly worth applying to; only minor gaps or open questions.
- 5-6: Mixed, meets the must-haves, but several stated preferences go unmet; a genuine toss-up.
- 3-4: Weak, barely clears the must-haves, multiple real concerns.
- 0-2: Poor / near-dealbreaker, fails or barely meets what matters most.

Missing salary/compensation info is neutral, not a red flag, most postings simply don't disclose it. Never
list "no salary shown" or similar as a con, and never let it lower the score. Only treat compensation as a
signal when a number IS disclosed: a rate/range that meets or exceeds the candidate's expectations is a
genuine pro; one that falls short is a genuine con.
