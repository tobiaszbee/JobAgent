# JobAgent

An AI-powered job search assistant that collects remote job listings, ranks them with a multi-stage AI pipeline, and learns your preferences from your apply/reject decisions over time.

JobAgent is a local, single-user client with **no database of its own** — every read and write goes through [JobAgentWeb](../JobAgentWeb), the Postgres-backed API service that owns all data. This split lets the scraped job pool be shared across users while each user's scoring/ranking/decisions stay private.

Each run makes the next one smarter: your decisions feed the preference distiller, which shapes scoring and ranking. First-time visitors land on a short questionnaire (CV + work mode/salary/seniority/company/stack preferences) before the dashboard appears at all.

---

## Setup

This is a two-repo, self-hosted setup — JobAgent (this repo, the local client) plus [JobAgentWeb](../JobAgentWeb) (a separate FastAPI + Postgres backend you also deploy yourself), not a single pip-install tool. Budget for standing up both before you have a working system.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Google Chrome (for LinkedIn scraping)
- [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/) — Claude Sonnet, Haiku, Opus
- [Voyage AI API key](https://www.voyageai.com/) — embeddings + reranker
- A LinkedIn account
- A running [JobAgentWeb](../JobAgentWeb) instance, reachable from this machine (see below)

### Installation

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd JobAgent
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
VOYAGE_API_KEY=pa-...
JOBAGENTWEB_BASE_URL=http://10.66.0.1:8000   # only if different from the default
```

`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `VOYAGE_API_KEY` are required at import time — `config.py` raises immediately if either is missing, so nothing (not even the dashboard) starts without both set.

`JOBAGENTWEB_BASE_URL` defaults to a WireGuard-tunneled address, **not** a public HTTPS URL — if JobAgentWeb sits behind a reverse proxy with HTTP basic auth in front of it (as on the reference deployment), that auth blocks API traffic exactly like it blocks a browser, since there's no way for it to tell the two apart. Point this at whatever address reaches JobAgentWeb without hitting that wall — a private tunnel, an internal network address, or a version of the proxy that lets `/api/*` through unauthenticated in favor of JobAgentWeb's own session login.

### Start the dashboard and log in

```bash
python web/app.py
```

Open `http://localhost:5000` — with no saved session yet, this lands on `/login`. Log in with your JobAgentWeb username/password (no account yet? Register at `<JOBAGENTWEB_BASE_URL>/register` first — registration requires an invite code, so get one from the operator of that JobAgentWeb instance before you start); the session cookie is saved to `~/.jobagent/session.json` and reused by every script and the dashboard afterward. On first visit after logging in (no saved preferences yet) you land on a landing page that routes you into the questionnaire; the dashboard itself only appears once a preference profile exists.

Headless/server installs with no browser access to port 5000 can authenticate the same way from a terminal instead:

```bash
python scripts/login.py
```

---

## User manual — step by step

### Step 1 — Fill out the questionnaire

On first visit you land on a landing page and are routed to `/questionnaire`. Upload a PDF résumé — Claude parses it into a structured candidate profile injected into every scoring prompt — plus a set of optional preference sections, all editable later from **Actions → Change criteria** on the dashboard:

| Section | Feeds into |
|---------|-----------|
| Work mode & location | Remote countries / hybrid-onsite cities — drives the deterministic remote-only dealbreaker filter, the collector's search locations, and the dashboard's Countries/Cities filters |
| Compensation | Annual salary floor + currency — drives the deterministic salary-floor dealbreaker filter (job pay is normalized to annual before comparing, whatever period it's quoted in) |
| Seniority & role | Soft scoring context; also feeds auto-derived search queries |
| Company | Preferred company type/product-vs-outsourcing — soft scoring context |
| Technologies (required / avoid) | Auto-derived search titles + the rejected-keyword filter |
| Languages | Auto-rejects postings whose detected language doesn't match any you listed |
| Anything else | Free-text notes injected into the candidate profile |

Every section is optional except the CV — leave one blank and it's simply not used as a filter or signal, never treated as a violation. Saving the questionnaire also regenerates the collector's search criteria (titles derived by Claude from your tech/role/seniority, locations from work mode, rejected keywords from avoided tech) — there's no separate criteria-editing UI; it's fully driven by this form.

### Step 2 — First Run Agent

Click **Run agent** in the header. A modal lets you configure:
- **Search since last run** (default, recommended) — automatically covers every day since the last successful run
- **Search last N days** — manual override if you uncheck the above

The pipeline runs in order:
1. Collect jobs from configured sources
2. Distill preferences from your history (skipped on first run — no history yet)
3. Extract structured data (remote/hybrid, seniority, stack, salary, company type) — must run before scoring, since both the dealbreaker filter and the scorer read it
4. Apply the deterministic dealbreaker pre-filter (salary floor, remote-only mismatch) — zero LLM cost for jobs it catches
5. Score surviving jobs with Claude Sonnet
6. Embed, rerank, and listwise-rank the pool, then run the debate/second-opinion pass over the top-20

**First run — LinkedIn login:** Chrome opens and pauses at the LinkedIn login screen. Log in manually. Your session is saved to `data/chrome_profile/` and reused on all future runs.

### Step 3 — Review jobs

After the run, browse the **New** tab. For each job card:

- Click the title to open the original posting
- Expand **Why this score** for the sub-score breakdown (stack/seniority/company/compensation fit) and pros/cons
- Expand **Description** to read it without leaving the dashboard
- A **Second opinion** callout appears if the debate pass flagged the job (`dealbreaker_risk`, `overrated`, or `underrated`) — dealbreaker-risk jobs are visually dimmed and sorted to the bottom of the ranked shortlist
- Use the action buttons:

| Button | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Reviewed** | You've read it; staying visible but not yet decided |
| **Applied ✓** | You applied; becomes a positive example for future scoring |
| **Reject ✗** | Opens a reason box; becomes a negative example |

**Tip:** Write a rejection reason — e.g. "stawka za niska", "outsourcing body shop", "too junior". These are included verbatim in the preference distillation prompt and directly influence what Opus extracts as signals.

**Bulk actions:** Click **Select** in the toolbar to enter selection mode. Select multiple cards, then apply a status to all at once from the bulk bar. For bulk reject, a shared reason input appears.

### Step 4 — Filter and search

The toolbar and **More filters** modal offer several ways to narrow the list:

- **Search bar** — searches title, company, location, description, and AI reasoning text simultaneously
- **Score** — filter to one or more *exact* score values (not a min/max range), each shown with its job count
- **Sort** — AI rank (default), score, date, or company
- **More filters** — work type (remote/hybrid/on-site), seniority, company type, product-vs-outsourcing, tech stack, source, company, and separate **Cities** (hybrid/on-site) vs **Countries** (remote — derived from the free-text location field, validated against a real country/region list) groups
- Clicking any badge on a job card (company, location, work type, seniority, stack…) toggles that same filter directly. Active filters appear as chips above the job list.

### Step 5 — Second run and beyond

After you've reviewed a batch:

1. Click **Run agent** again, or use **Actions** for a narrower re-run: **Re-score new jobs**, **Re-evaluate auto-rejected**, or **Rank jobs (AI)** alone
2. The distiller runs first — it reads your decisions and updates the preference profile
3. New jobs get scored and ranked using your updated profile
4. The AI rank badge (`#N`) on each card shows the Opus listwise position; the **Calibration** panel shows Precision@5/@10 and divergence cases (rank ≤5 but rejected, or rank ≥16 but applied) — click it for the full report

**The loop:** every apply/reject decision improves the next ranking. After ~20–30 decisions the preference profile becomes meaningful. After ~50+ it converges.

### Step 6 — Other actions

Everything below lives in the **Actions** modal (header, next to Run agent):

| Action | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Rank jobs (AI)** | Run only the Voyage + Opus ranking (+ debate) step, without collecting or scoring |
| **Re-score new jobs** | After reviewing many jobs — re-scores with updated preferences without collecting |
| **Re-evaluate auto-rejected** | After changing keywords/preferences — re-runs the filters + scoring on all auto-rejected jobs |
| **Fetch missing descriptions** | Retries jobs collected without a description; badge shows how many are pending |
| **Change criteria** | Back to `/questionnaire` |
| **Delete jobs** | Bulk-delete by status and date range — removes them from *your* view only; a posting other users have found stays in the shared pool |

## Dashboard reference

### Tabs

| Tab | Shows |
|-----|-------|
| **New** | Unreviewed jobs (default) |
| **Reviewed** | Jobs you've read but not decided on |
| **Applied** | Jobs you applied to |
| **Rejected** | Jobs you manually rejected |
| **Auto-rejected** | Jobs auto-rejected by the keyword/language filters or the dealbreaker filter |
| **All** | Everything |

The pipeline funnel in the summary band mirrors these same counts and doubles as a status filter — clicking a step is equivalent to clicking the matching tab.

### Summary band

| Panel | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Pipeline | New/Reviewed/Applied/Rejected/Auto-rejected counts, clickable |
| Avg score | Average score across **pending, new-only** jobs — excludes anything already decided so old decisions can't drag the number around |
| Calibration | Precision@5 / Precision@10 + divergence case count; click for the full report |
| Cost | Cost per 100 jobs, today's spend, all-time spend |

Below that, **"What the agent learned"** renders the distilled preference profile's signals as plain-language chips (Likes / Avoids / Inferred / No signal), with a link to the full profile and a refresh button.

## Technical deep-dive

### Data ownership

JobAgent holds no database. Every `db/repositories/*.py` module is a thin wrapper over `api_client.py`, which makes authenticated HTTP calls to JobAgentWeb. The schema itself — `job_postings`/`job_embeddings` (shared across every user) plus `user_job_states` and everything else (per-user) — lives in [JobAgentWeb's `migrations.py`](../JobAgentWeb/migrations.py); see that repo's README for the full table layout.

Two consequences worth knowing:
- **"Delete jobs"** removes rows from *your* `user_job_states` only — the underlying shared posting stays untouched for other users who've found the same URL.
- **Every script needs a valid session** (log in via the dashboard's `/login` page, or `python scripts/login.py` for headless installs) — there is no local fallback if JobAgentWeb is unreachable.

### Pipeline stages in detail

#### 1. Collection

`collector/runner.py` orchestrates all sources. Each source implements `JobSource.search(title, location, days_back, max_results, known_urls)` and returns `RawJob` objects. After collection:

- Jobs are deduplicated by URL only (JobAgentWeb's shared `job_postings` table enforces this) — existing postings are skipped; only new ones are inserted
- New LinkedIn jobs are checked against `rejected` keywords **by title alone** before a description is fetched — a job that's already doomed never costs a page load (`collector/filters.py → title_banned_reason`)
- LinkedIn descriptions are fetched with Playwright, with delays that scale to what's actually happening on the page instead of a flat random range

LinkedIn stealth parameters (`config.py → STEALTH`):
```python
# Search phase — pause after each (title, location) search
search_glance:     5–20 s   flat "glanced at results" component, always applied
search_new:        10–30 s  per newly-found job on that page (0 s added if all duplicates)

# Description phase — one browser session per batch
desc_delay:        8–45 s, scaled to word count (~200 wpm) ± 15% variance
batch_size:        10 descriptions per session
batch_pause:       120–600 s between batches
distract_every_n_batches: 2   # visits a random LinkedIn page (feed/network/jobs) between batches
```

Both delay types keep a 5% chance of an extra 60–300 s pause ("stepped away"), independent of page content.

#### How LinkedIn keyword search actually behaves

This took a lot of live trial and error to pin down — worth reading before changing `title`/`search_query` criteria.

**Every search phrase is wrapped in quotes** (`collector/sources/linkedin.py → search()`): `Senior PHP Developer` becomes `"Senior PHP Developer"` in the `keywords=` URL param. Quotes force LinkedIn to require that **exact phrase as a literal substring** somewhere in the job's searchable text — not "these words in any order" and not a fuzzy/semantic match.

- **Without quotes**, LinkedIn matches loosely on individual words (its own relevance ranking, not a literal filter). This is what searching bare `php` originally did, and it returned Ruby, Java, Salesforce, and Data Engineer postings that had nothing to do with PHP — confirmed by direct testing, which is why quoting was added.
- **Word order matters completely** with quotes, because it's a literal substring match: `"PHP Engineer"` and `"Engineer PHP"` return **completely different, non-overlapping** result sets (verified live — 6 vs 8 results, zero titles in common). Neither is "wrong"; they just catch different real-world title phrasings.
- **A short phrase is a superset of any longer phrase that contains it.** `"PHP Developer"` matches everywhere `"Senior PHP Developer"` would, plus more (`"Lead PHP Developer"`, `"Full Stack PHP Developer"`, bare `"PHP Developer"` with no prefix). This is why the criteria list was consolidated — dropping a redundant longer variant never loses coverage, as long as it's a literal substring of the phrase kept.
- **`"X Software Engineer"` is NOT a superset relationship with `"X Engineer"`** — "Software" sits in between, so these are two different, non-overlapping phrases, not a longer/shorter pair of the same one. Confirmed live: `"Python Software Engineer"` and `"Python Engineer"` returned entirely different job postings. Don't assume any two phrases that "feel similar" are substrings of each other — check literally.

**The best-performing phrase found by testing is the bare quoted language name** — `"PHP"` / `"Python"` alone, no "Developer"/"Engineer" suffix. Verified across Germany, Poland, Denmark, and the US (remote-only + last-24h filters, matching production conditions):
- Never returned zero results, unlike almost every multi-word phrase tried.
- Still clean — sampling 35+ results across two countries found no unrelated (non-PHP, non-IT) postings.
- Catches title patterns no multi-word phrase can, because the word can appear anywhere: `"Senior Backend Engineer, PHP"`, `"Software Engineer – Python"`, `"Backend-Entwickler (Python / PHP)"`.
- Also catches non-English postings, since the token itself isn't translated: German `"PHP-Entwickler"`, `"PHP Softwareentwickler"` all matched a plain `"PHP"` search — a real language-coverage win, since the DACH market posts heavily in German.

Because bare `"PHP"`/`"Python"` is a superset of `"PHP Developer"`, `"PHP Engineer"`, `"PHP Team Lead"`, etc. (all of them literally contain the word), those narrower variants were retired from the `title` criteria. **What's left needs its own entry per framework** (`Symfony Developer`, `Django Developer`, `Laravel Developer`, `FastAPI Developer`, `Flask Developer`) because a framework name doesn't contain the literal word "PHP" or "Python" — bare `"PHP"` won't find a posting titled just `"Symfony Developer"`.

**LinkedIn also supports real Boolean operators** — uppercase `AND` / `OR` / `NOT`, order-independent (`php AND developer` ≡ `developer AND php`, verified live). Tempting, because it directly fixes "0 results" — `php AND developer` returned 500+ hits vs 0–24 for any quoted phrase. **Deliberately not used**: Boolean operators match against the full job description, not just the title, so `php AND developer` also surfaces Java/.NET/generic "Backend Developer" postings where "php" is merely one word buried in a long tech-stack list. Sampled live across 4 countries: roughly half of the top results per search had no PHP/Python connection visible in the title at all. This reintroduces exactly the noise quoting was meant to eliminate, and the existing `required` keyword safety net doesn't help here — `required=[php, python]` can never reject an AND-sourced result, because the search only matched it *because* that word is already present somewhere in the document.

**The "no results" trap this all depends on getting right:** when a quoted phrase matches nothing, LinkedIn doesn't show an empty page — it shows "No matching jobs found" plus an unrelated **"Jobs you may be interested in"** widget (your own personalized recommendations, unrelated to the search). That widget reuses the exact same markup (`.scaffold-layout__list-item`) as real results, so a naive scraper — which is what this one used to be — silently scrapes someone's LinkedIn recommendations and inserts them as if they were real search hits for that query. `_collect_cards()` now checks for `.jobs-search-no-results-banner` and treats its presence as zero results. This is the reason `days_back=1` combined with narrow/compound phrases so often logged identical "found" jobs across unrelated queries and countries before the fix — always double-check this isn't happening again if search result counts look suspiciously identical across different queries.

**The actual reason for frequent "0 new jobs" isn't the phrase, usually — it's `days_back=1` + remote-only (`f_WT=2`) stacked together.** Verified live: `"Python Developer"` in Germany with no date filter has 24 results; the same phrase restricted to the last 24 hours has 0. Multiply that scarcity across every (title, location) combination run daily, and most individual searches will legitimately find nothing new — this is expected, not a bug, given how narrow the freshness window is relative to real posting volume for any single niche+country combination.

#### 2. Preference distillation

`preference_agent/runner.py` — runs with **Claude Opus 4.8**.

Inputs:
- All `applied` jobs (title, company, location, description up to 1500 chars)
- Up to 50 most recent `rejected` jobs with user-written rejection reasons
- Dismissed score factors — specific pros/cons the candidate explicitly said don't apply to them
- Up to 10 divergence cases: jobs ranked ≤ 5 by Opus but rejected by user, or ranked ≥ 16 but applied to (strongest learning signal)

Output — a list of `ProfileSignal` objects:
```
ACCEPT[company_type=product_saas; conf=HIGH; n=3/3]
REJECT[company_type=agency_outsourcing; conf=ABSOLUTE; n=5/5; note="body shop"]
INFER[compensation=min_100_eur_h; from=3 examples]
NEUTRAL[contract_form; no_signal]
```

Confidence levels: `ABSOLUTE > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW`. `NEUTRAL` signals are stripped before being injected into the scorer.

The distiller skips if `applied_count`, `rejected_count`, and `dismissed_count` are all unchanged since the last saved profile.

Distillation is triggered as a pipeline step — not on every decision:
- At the start of **Run Agent** (before scoring new jobs)
- At the start of **Re-score new**
- On demand from **Preferences** modal

#### 3. Structured extraction

`extractor/runner.py` — runs with **Claude Haiku 4.5**, tool-use API (`submit_structured_data`). Runs **before** scoring — the dealbreaker filter and the scorer both read `structured_data`, so a freshly-collected job needs to be extracted before either can use it.

Extracts per-job JSON from the description (first 3000 chars):
```json
{
  "remote": true,
  "hybrid": false,
  "seniority": "senior",
  "salary_min": 100, "salary_max": 145, "salary_period": "hourly", "salary_currency": "PLN",
  "stack": ["Python", "Django", "PostgreSQL"],
  "company_type": "startup",
  "product_vs_outsourcing": "product",
  "working_language": "english"
}
```

Fields default to `null` when not explicitly stated — no inference. `salary_period` (hourly/monthly/yearly) exists specifically so a B2B hourly rate is never silently mistaken for an annual figure downstream. Stored via JobAgentWeb as JSON on the shared posting (`job_postings.structured_data`) — extracted once, reused by every user who has the same job. Powers the clickable badge/filter dimensions in the dashboard.

#### 4. Dealbreaker pre-filter

`evaluator/dealbreakers.py::apply_dealbreaker_filter()` — deterministic, no LLM call, runs immediately before the scoring loop over not-yet-scored jobs. Auto-rejects (score `0.0`, `status='auto_rejected'`, reason in `score_reason`) any job that violates a **structured**-field dealbreaker from the questionnaire:

- **Salary floor** — job pay is normalized to an annual-gross basis (`_annualize()`: hourly ×2016, monthly ×12) before comparing against the candidate's annual `salary_min`. Currency mismatches and unknown pay periods are **skipped, not rejected** — absence of comparable data is never treated as a violation.
- **Remote-only mismatch** — if the candidate's `work_mode` is exactly `["remote"]` and the job's structured data says `hybrid=true` or `remote=false`, it's rejected. Missing remote/hybrid data is skipped, never guessed.

This is the only auto-reject path that runs on structured data rather than title/description keywords — it exists to catch dealbreakers a keyword filter structurally can't (e.g. a rate that's only wrong once you know the currency and pay period).

#### 5. Scoring

`evaluator/scorer.py` — runs with **Claude Sonnet 4.6**, tool-use API (`submit_score`). Only jobs that survive the dealbreaker filter reach this step.

Prompt sections, in order: candidate profile (from CV) → learned preference profile (from distillation, with confidence-weighted interpretation legend) → few-shot applied/rejected examples → calibration section (past ranking-vs-decision divergences, so the model stops repeating the same misjudgment) → MUST HAVE / PREFERRED criteria → an explicit instruction that **missing salary disclosure is neutral, never a con** — only a disclosed rate that under/overshoots the candidate's floor counts as a genuine con/pro.

Output (`submit_score` tool):
```json
{
  "sub_scores": {"stack_fit": 8, "seniority_fit": 9, "company_fit": 6, "compensation_fit": 5},
  "pros": ["Exact stack match", "Fully remote, product company"],
  "cons": ["Company type slightly off from product-SaaS preference"],
  "overall_score": 7.5,
  "score_reason": "Strong stack and seniority fit at a solid product company."
}
```
`overall_score` is the model's own holistic judgment — never a formula over `sub_scores`, since non-linear reasoning (dealbreaker penalties, MUST-HAVE logic) needs to stay possible. `sub_scores`/`pros`/`cons` are for dashboard transparency, stored as JSON (`score_breakdown`).

#### 6. Embeddings

`embeddings/indexer.py` + `embeddings/client.py` — **Voyage voyage-3-large**, 1024-dim.

Each job is embedded as: `"{title} at {company}\n{description[:2000]}"` with `input_type="document"`. Vectors are stored via JobAgentWeb's shared `job_embeddings` table — computed once per posting, reused by every user.

The **ideal candidate vector** is computed from your feedback:
```
ideal = centroid(applied_embeddings) − 0.3 × centroid(rejected_embeddings)
```

The 0.3 weight on rejected embeddings pushes the ideal vector away from job types you've rejected without over-correcting. Falls back to embedding the CV summary when there's no applied-job history yet, so a new candidate's first run still gets semantic ranking instead of arbitrary scrape-recency order. Each new job is scored by cosine similarity to this vector → stored as `embedding_score`.

#### 7. Cross-encoder rerank

`ranker/reranker.py` — **Voyage rerank-2**.

Top-50 jobs by `embedding_score` are passed to the cross-encoder with a query derived from the CV summary and preference signals. The cross-encoder evaluates each (query, document) pair jointly (not independently like an embedding model), giving more accurate relevance scores. Top-20 by `rerank_score` proceed to listwise ranking.

#### 8. Listwise ranking

`ranker/listwise.py` — **Claude Opus 4.8** with extended thinking (`adaptive` mode, `effort=high`).

The top-20 jobs from the reranker are passed together in a single prompt. Opus sees all 20 simultaneously and ranks them relative to each other — not by absolute score. This is the key advantage over pairwise scoring: Opus can reason about trade-offs across the full set.

Output format — JSON in `<ranking>` tags:
```json
[
  {"job_id": "abc123", "reason": "Exact stack match, product company, senior role"},
  {"job_id": "def456", "reason": "Good match but agency, lower confidence"},
  ...
]
```

Each job gets a `listwise_rank` (1 = best) and `rank_reason`. Jobs outside the top-20 are not ranked (NULL).

Extended thinking lets Opus internally reason about candidate-job fit before committing to an ordering. This produces more consistent rankings than a simple prompt.

#### 9. Debate / second opinion

`ranker/debate.py::debate_rank()` — runs with **Claude Sonnet 4.6** (deliberately a different model from the Opus listwise ranker) over just the top-20 shortlist, right after listwise ranking.

The critic sees the current order plus each job's `rank_reason` and `score_breakdown` (pros/cons), and does **not** re-rank from scratch — it only flags disagreements it feels strongly about, via `submit_debate_review`:

- `dealbreaker_risk` — the primary ranking likely missed a real dealbreaker (e.g. stack similarity masking a seniority or company-type mismatch) → **demoted to the bottom** of the shortlist, `listwise_rank` renumbered accordingly
- `overrated` / `underrated` — surfaced as a note on the card, doesn't reorder anything

Most jobs get no flag at all — the prompt explicitly discourages flagging just to have something to say. Flag + note are stored (`debate_flag` / `debate_note`) and shown as a "Second opinion" callout on the dashboard.

#### 10. Would-apply flag

`ranker/would_apply.py` — phase 1 of an eventual auto-apply feature. Flags jobs the agent would apply to, purely for the candidate to validate — **never sends anything**. Gate is an absolute score floor (`config.WOULD_APPLY["score_floor"]`, currently 7.0), not a relative top-N cut, so a weak ranking run yields zero flagged jobs instead of always flagging "the best of a bad batch." A `dealbreaker_risk` debate flag always suppresses the would-apply flag.

#### Evaluation metrics

`GET /api/eval/report` returns:

- **Precision@5** and **Precision@10** — of the top-K ranked, already-decided jobs (`applied`/`rejected`/`auto_rejected` — `reviewed` doesn't count, it's read-but-undecided), what fraction did the user apply to? Higher = better ranking.
- **Divergence cases** — jobs where ranking and user decision strongly disagree:
  - `rank ≤ 5` + `status = rejected` → false positive (Opus liked it, you didn't)
  - `rank ≥ 16` + `status = applied` → false negative (Opus missed a good one)
- **Would-apply precision** — of jobs flagged would_apply, what fraction were actually applied to (vs rejected)?

Divergence cases are fed back into the next distillation run as high-priority signals.

### Model usage and approximate costs

| Stage | Model | Cost approx. |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Distillation | Opus 4.8 | ~$0.40/run (50 jobs × 1500 chars) |
| Extraction | Haiku 4.5 | ~$0.001/job |
| Dealbreaker filter | — (deterministic) | free |
| Scoring | Sonnet 4.6 | ~$0.007/job |
| Embedding | Voyage voyage-3-large | $0.18/1M tokens |
| Reranking | Voyage rerank-2 | $0.05/1M tokens |
| Listwise rank | Opus 4.8 | ~$0.40/run (top-20 jobs) |
| Debate / second opinion | Sonnet 4.6 | ~$0.02/run (top-20 jobs, single call) |

**Distillation runs once per Run Agent / Re-score, not on every decision.** This is the most expensive step; the budget is fixed (~50 jobs in context) regardless of total job count. The dealbreaker filter catches some jobs before scoring ever runs, reducing Sonnet spend for a candidate with a firm salary floor or remote-only requirement.

### Cost tracking

Every API call logs usage through JobAgentWeb. The dashboard's Cost panel shows cost per 100 jobs, today's spend, and all-time spend. The `MODEL_COSTS` dict in `config.py` holds the rates — update it if pricing changes.

## Running tests

```bash
pytest                  # unit + integration
pytest tests/unit/
pytest tests/integration/
pytest -m e2e           # real Anthropic API calls — requires funded ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

JobAgent has no local database, so `tests/conftest.py` spins up a **real** JobAgentWeb instance as a subprocess (from a sibling `../JobAgentWeb` checkout, its own venv) pointed at a dedicated `jobagentweb_test` Postgres database — the same one JobAgentWeb's own test suite uses. This means:

- **The JobAgentWeb Postgres tunnel must be reachable** from wherever you run the suite (see JobAgentWeb's README for the connection details).
- Every test gets a freshly-registered JobAgentWeb user for isolation — no mocks against a fake backend.
- `job_postings`/`job_embeddings` are shared/global and never truncated between tests, so tests that insert jobs use unique URLs to avoid colliding with another test's data.

~800 unit/integration tests, a few minutes total (dominated by starting the JobAgentWeb subprocess once per session). The e2e suite (~9 tests) makes real Claude calls and needs actual Anthropic credit balance — expect these to fail with a billing error, not a code bug, if the account isn't funded.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Agent finds no jobs** — check that criteria (search queries/titles + locations) exist. These are normally auto-generated by saving the questionnaire (`/questionnaire`); if they look empty, resave it.

**LinkedIn login required** — on first run, Chrome opens at the login page. Log in manually; your session is saved to `data/chrome_profile/`. If it expires, delete that directory and log in again.

**Scraping breaks / wrong jobs** — LinkedIn occasionally changes its HTML. Update CSS selectors in `collector/sources/linkedin.py`.

**`NotLoggedInError` / 401s from every script** — your session expired or was never created. Open the dashboard (it redirects to `/login` automatically) or run `python scripts/login.py` again.

**`overloaded` from Anthropic** — the evaluator retries automatically (3×, 30 s / 60 s). If it keeps failing, wait and retry.

**Dashboard shows "Running" with nothing running** — a session was left in `status='running'` after a crash. It auto-clears after 6 hours, or click **Actions → Stop** to cancel it immediately via JobAgentWeb's API.

**Jobs missing descriptions** — open **Actions → Fetch missing descriptions**.

**Ranking badges not showing** — structured extraction (`extract_jobs.py`) hasn't run yet. After adding Anthropic credits, run:
```bash
python scripts/extract_jobs.py
```

**Voyage rate limit errors** — the free tier allows 3 RPM. Add a payment method on [dashboard.voyageai.com](https://dashboard.voyageai.com) to unlock 600 RPM. Then update `BATCH_SIZE=128` and `BATCH_DELAY=1` in `embeddings/indexer.py`.

**Score not changing after re-score** — the distiller skips if `applied_count`/`rejected_count`/`dismissed_count` haven't changed since the last run. Mark at least one job as applied or rejected first.
