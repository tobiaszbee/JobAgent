"""
Re-rank the entire active ('new') job pool using the full AI pipeline:
1. Semantic similarity (Voyage embeddings) — broad recall
2. Voyage cross-encoder rerank (top-50) — precision
3. Claude Opus listwise ranking with extended thinking (top-20) — final ordering

Runs over ALL 'new' jobs every time (not just newly-collected ones), so listwise_rank
stays comparable across the whole list instead of being scoped to one day's batch.
